0,"French President Emmanuel Macron has told Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison he has broken the trust between their two countries and it is up to Canberra to repair relations, the Elysee Palace says.In the call on Thursday, which came ahead of a UN climate change summit in Glasgow, Macron also urged Morrison to commit to halting coal mining and the use of coal for power production.Relations between France and Australia soured when Canberra signed up to the AUKUS partnership which involved the US and the UK helping Australia create a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines.The new partnership meant Australia scrapped a $A90 billion deal for France to supply diesel-electric submarines.The call between the pair, who will both attend a G20 summit in Rome later this week, is the first time the two leaders have spoken since France was informed by letter that Canberra was scrapping the 2016 submarine deal.While France has sought to mend fences with Washington, with Macron due to meet US President Joe Biden on Friday in Rome, it had frozen its contacts with Australia.“President Macron recalled that Australia’s unilateral decision to scale back the French-Australian strategic partnership by putting an end to the ocean-class submarine programme in favour of another as-yet unspecified project broke the relationship of trust between our two countries,” the Elysee Palace said in a statement on Thursday.“The situation of the French businesses and their subcontractors, including Australian companies, affected by this decision will be given our utmost attention.“It is now up to the Australian Government to propose tangible actions that embody the political will of Australia’s highest authorities to redefine the basis of our bilateral relationship and continue joint action in the Indo-Pacific.”",Emmanuel Macron tells Scott Morrison ‘trust was broken’ after AUKUS submarine deal,['French President Emmanuel Macron has told Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison he has broken the trust between their two countries.<n>Relations soured when Canberra signed up to the AUKUS partnership which involved the US and the UK helping Australia create a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines.<n>The new partnership meant Australia scrapped a $A90 billion deal for France to supply diesel-electric submarines.']

2,"Twenty-eight days after a corruption inquiry forced her to resign as NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian will get the opportunity to address the allegations against her.Berejiklian’s secret partner Daryl Maguire was the one originally under the microscope of the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption last year, for allegedly using his position as an MP to gain a financial benefit for himself.But when she sensationally revealed their clandestine relationship, it sparked a separate investigation into her own conduct, which resulted in her resigning as premier on October 1.ICAC is investigating how the relationship may have impacted the way Berejiklian - as treasurer and then premier - dealt with projects the former Wagga Wagga MP lobbied for.On Friday she will get her chance to answer the allegations against her, a day after Maguire told the inquiry the pair loved each other, contemplated marriage and discussed having a child.The former premier last year told ICAC the pair’s relationship was not of “sufficient status” to disclose to anyone.She earlier on Thursday lost a bid to have ICAC hear details of the relationship in private.“There is no public purpose served by plumbing the depths of the private life of my client,” her lawyer Sophie Callan SC argued.“Doing so in public will inevitably lead to intense and irremediable publicity and public scrutiny along with humiliation and harm.”Assistant Commissioner Ruth McColl denied the request, saying the matter was in the public interest.Maguire on Thursday conceded the relationship gave him greater access to Berejiklian than other MPs, and in their private life he “encouraged” her to take a close interest in projects he was lobbying for.He denied he ever explicitly asked his partner to intervene, but conceded he would sometimes communicate with her in the hope she would.The public hearings have focused on two grants - a $5.5 million upgrade to the Wagga Wagga Clay Target Club, and a $20.5 million plan to build a recital hall for the Riverina Conservatorium of Music.Berejiklian denies any wrongdoing, but in a tearful press conference earlier this month said she had “no option” other than to resign.“History will demonstrate that I have always executed my duties with the highest degree of integrity for the benefit of the people of NSW, who I have had the privilege to serve,” Berejiklian told reporters.",Gladys Berejiklian to face ICAC on Friday after Daryl Maguire aired details of intimate relationship,"['Gladys Berejiklian will address allegations against her at ICAC on Friday.<n>She resigned as NSW premier on October 1 after a corruption inquiry forced her to resign as treasurer and then premier.<n>ICAC is investigating how the relationship may have impacted the way Berejiklian dealt with projects Daryl Maguire lobbied for.<n>Maguire told the inquiry the pair loved each other, contemplated marriage and discussed having a child.']"

6,"Barnaby Joyce has finally revealed some of the detail the Nationals secured in agreeing with the plan for net zero emissions by 2050, including a regional fund to assist the transition.Prime Minister Scott Morrison is in Rome for the G20 Summit and will then head to the UN climate conference in Glasgow to present Australia’s emissions reduction plan.Joyce, the Nationals leader and currently acting prime minister, said if what people say about global trends is correct, then there is a need for a parallel income for regional Australia.“They need a fund that actually inspires the new businesses that will employ people to start up, if what the globe is saying is going to happen,” Joyce told Sky News’ Sunday Agenda programHowever, he did not divulge how big the fund would be.The Nationals also secured the exclusion of so-called ‘scope 3 emissions’, which accounts for emissions from coal mining in Australia and then accounts for them again when the coal is burned in China.“It’s basically double accounting,” Joyce said.“We had to make sure we maintained what is a vital part of regional Australia.”Energy and Emissions Reductions Minister Angus Taylor is travelling with the prime minister to Glasgow.He told ABC’s Insiders program from Rome the government has allocated $20 billion over the next ten years to put Australia on the path to 2050 through new technologies.“That’s the goal and that means you avoid having to pay the very significant cost of having a carbon tax,” Taylor said.Repeatedly pressed on whether the $20 billion outlay will be sufficient to reach the 2050 target, Taylor said: “What a government in the 2040s, or 2045 or 2047 spends will be up to that government.”“We don’t need to impose a carbon tax.”‘We don’t need to impose a carbon tax.’But former Liberal finance minister and now Secretary-General of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Mattheus Cormann believes there needs to be a price on carbon.“I have had a consistent view that in order to be generally effective and publicly supported over the long run you need a globally coordinated approach,” Cormann told Sky News in Rome.“A consistently applied price on carbon globally could be the most efficient.”",Barnaby Joyce details some of Nationals deal to accept a net zero emissions 2050 target,"['Prime Minister Scott Morrison is in Rome for the G20 Summit and will then head to the UN climate conference in Glasgow to present Australia’s emissions reduction plan.<n>The Nationals secured the exclusion of so-called ‘scope 3 emissions’, which accounts for emissions from coal mining in Australia and then accounts for them again when the coal is burned in China.<n>Energy and Emissions Reductions Minister Angus Taylor is travelling with the prime minister to Glasgow.<n>Former Liberal finance minister and now Secretary-General of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Mattheus Cormann believes there needs to be a price on carbon.']"
7,"Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets of Melbourne to protest about new lockdown laws just hours after the city began to relish its extra freedoms.A large crowd of protesters met outside Parliament House with a number of messages for Daniel Andrews and the state’s leaders.But one grew louder than most at the first legal protest in a long time.“Kill the bill,” protesters chanted.It’s a reference to the controversial pandemic laws currently before MPs.The Victorian government has introduced new laws to parliament that would allow the health minister to make public health orders for the COVID-19 pandemic.The Public Health and Wellbeing (Pandemic Management) Bill 2021 aims to give the state’s premier the power to declare a pandemic and extend it in three-month blocks for as long as considered necessary.Earlier this week, Andrews said the government had flagged this would happen and that this framework goes further in terms of “scrutiny and transparency”.“We said as the state of emergency and legislative arrangements fell due, we would introduce pandemic-specific laws,” he said.“We would have a set of measures that were not written with a hypothetical in mind, but were the product of learning and the experiences that we’ve all been through of these last 20-plus months.“That’s exactly the framework we have introduced into the parliament.”The declaration will give the health minister “broad powers to make pandemic orders” on the chief health officer’s advice and will replace the current state of emergency, which expires on December 15.A similar process is in place in NSW and New Zealand, where the health minister is directly accountable to parliament.But the proposed Victorian laws go further, with an independent oversight committee to review the public orders and their impact on human rights, while public health advice will need to be made public.The laws also introduce safeguards around protecting contact tracing and QR code information, while an aggravated offence will be created to “deter ... the most egregious pandemic-related behaviours”.Court-imposed penalties will be introduced to stop businesses receiving commercial benefit from breaching a pandemic order.Victoria’s Liberal Leader Matthew Guy described the law as an “extreme power” and asked why it would be needed if lockdowns were a thing of the past.“Noting the extreme nature of the government’s proposed pandemic law, the Liberals and National parties resolved this morning to stand up for Victorians and oppose it,” he tweeted.“The state government has said they are ‘never locking us down again’ - so why such extreme legislation?”The opposition says the government is “drunk on power”, describing the proposed laws as “the most extreme, dangerous and excessive laws ever brought before our state”.“Daniel Andrews is attempting to sideline the Victorian chief health officer and grant himself unchecked power to declare a state of emergency,” Opposition Leader Matthew Guy said.If passed, pandemic-specific laws will replace the current state of emergency, which expires on December 15.Melbourne and Victoria’s regions reunited after coronavirus restrictions eased at 6pm on Friday, ahead of the state hitting its 80 per cent full vaccination target at the weekend.The border between Melbourne and the regions has now come down, masks no longer need to be worn outdoors, and capacity limits increased for restaurants, pubs and cafes, and indoor entertainment venues, gyms and retail reopened to fully vaccinated patrons.There were long lines outside stores at Bourke Street Mall and Chadstone shopping centre before doors were thrown open shoppers.With travel to and from the city no longer banned, tourism-starved regional operators are preparing for a wave of pent-up demand over the unofficial Melbourne Cup long weekend.The state recorded another 1355 locally acquired COVID-19 infections on Saturday, with 21,095 active cases across the state.Eleven Victorians, aged between 65 and 85, have died with the virus, bringing the toll from the latest outbreak to 293.COVID-19 Commander Jeroen Weimar said 18 per cent of the new infections were in children aged under 10, while two thirds of cases were aged under 40 and about one third under 20.“This continues to be cases predominantly in our unvaccinated communities and predominantly affecting younger Victorians,” he told reporters.“So, please, particularly for those people in their 20s, go out and get vaccinated.”- With AAP",‘KILL THE BILL’: Thousands of protesters take to Melbourne streets over COVID-19 pandemic laws,"['The Victorian government has introduced new laws to parliament that would allow the health minister to make public health orders for the COVID-19 pandemic.<n>The Public Health and Wellbeing (Pandemic Management) Bill 2021 aims to give the state’s premier the power to declare a pandemic and extend it in three-month blocks for as long as considered necessary.<n>If passed, pandemic-specific laws will replace the current state of emergency, which expires on December 15.<n>Eleven Victorians, aged between 65 and 85, have died with the virus, bringing the toll from the latest outbreak to 293.']"
8,"The armorer on the movie set where actor Alec Baldwin fatally shot a cinematographer last week has “no idea” where any live ammunition came from, her lawyers said Thursday.Rust armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed “is devastated and completely beside herself over the events that have transpired,” a statement from her attorney said.Halyna Hutchins, director of photography, died in the on-set shooting last week, and director Joel Souza was injured.The circumstances of the shooting in New Mexico are under investigation, and no charges have been filed.“Safety is Hannah’s number one priority on set. Ultimately this set would never have been compromised if live ammo were not introduced. Hannah has no idea where the live rounds came from,” the statement from her attorneys said.Court documents related to a search warrant say assistant director David Halls yelled “cold gun,” indicating it had no live rounds, as he handed the firearm to Baldwin before the shooting.Halls told authorities he should have checked the gun more thoroughly after noticing a difference in the ammunition rounds, according to a search warrant affidavit.Gutierrez-Reed’s attorneys, Jason Bowles and Robert Gorence, said that the guns were locked up at night and during lunch and that the armorer had sought more training on the movie.“Hannah was hired on two positions on this film, which made it extremely difficult to focus on her job as an armorer,” the statement says.“She fought for training, days to maintain weapons and proper time to prepare for gunfire but ultimately was overruled by production and her department. ““The whole production set became unsafe due to various factors, including lack of safety meetings.”But sources within the production told NBC News that it’s common practice for an armorer, like Gutierrez-Reed, to also have separate responsibilities within a prop team.And in Gutierrez-Reed’s case on Rust, she only worked two days in props and never had dual prop and weapons responsibilities on the same day, the production sources said.The Rust production was within guidelines set by the Teamsters, SAG, the Directors Guild of America, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and other unions, according to the sources.There were multiple safety meetings on the Rust set, including on the day of deadly shooting, and the production was not trying to cut corners, they said.The shooting occurred at the Bonanza Creek Ranch in Santa Fe County, which is often used for Western productions.Sources have told NBC News that the prop gun had misfired before.The attorneys for Gutierrez-Reed in Thursday’s statement referenced an “accidental discharge” of a weapon, saying that Gutierrez-Reed never had one.“The first one on this set was the prop master and the second was a stunt man after Hannah informed him his gun was hot with blanks,” the statement said.The “lead projectile” that killed Hutchins and injured Souza has been recovered, authorities said this week. It was found in Souza’s shoulder.Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza described what was fired as a “suspected live round.”Around 500 rounds were taken from the set as part of the investigation, including blanks, dummy rounds and what the sheriff described as suspected live rounds.He said Wednesday “there was some complacency on this set.”",Armorer on the set of ‘Rust’ says she has ‘NO IDEA’ where deadly ammunition that killed Halyna Hutchins came from,"['Hannah Gutierrez-Reed has no idea where live ammunition came from, her lawyers said Thursday.<n>Gutierrez-Reed was hired on two positions on the Rust set.<n>She only worked two days in props and never had dual prop and weapons responsibilities on the same day, sources say.<n>The shooting occurred at the Bonanza Creek Ranch in Santa Fe County, which is often used for Western productions.']"
9,"A small group of ultra-wealthy individuals could help solve world hunger with just a fraction of their net worth, says the director of the United Nations’ World Food Program.Billionaires need to “step up now, on a one-time basis”, said David Beasley in an interview on CNN’s Connect the World with Becky Anderson that aired Tuesday - citing specifically the world’s two richest men, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk.“$US6 ($A7.9) billion to help 42 million people that are literally going to die if we don’t reach them. It’s not complicated,” he added.Tesla chief executive Musk has a net worth of nearly $US289 ($A384) billion, according to Bloomberg, meaning that Beasley is asking for a donation of just 2 per cent of his fortune.The net worth of US billionaires has almost doubled since the pandemic began, standing at $US5.04 ($A6.7) trillion in October, according to progressive groups Institute for Policy Studies and Americans for Tax Fairness.A “perfect storm” of several crises, such as climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic, mean many nations are “knocking on famine’s door,” Beasley said.Half of the population of Afghanistan - 22.8 million people - face an acute hunger crisis, according to a WFP report released Monday. Rampant unemployment and a liquidity crisis means the country is teetering on the edge of a humanitarian crisis and 3.2 million children under the age of five are at risk, the report concluded.A series of new reports from the Biden administration issued a stark warning last week: The effects of climate change will be wide-reaching and will pose problems for every government.Among the reports, the administration details how climate change is driving migration, the first time the US government is officially recognising the link between climate change and migration. The WFP has warned about this swell of movement in the past, particularly in the “Dry Corridor” region in Central America.“For example, take the United States and the region in Central America, the Dry Corridor, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua - just down in that area alone,” said Beasley Tuesday.“We’re feeding a lot of people down there and the climate is just changing with hurricanes and flash flooding; it’s just devastating.”In Ethiopia, the WFP estimates that 5.2 million people are in urgent need of food assistance in the Tigray region, where Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has led a major offensive against the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) since last year.Thousands of civilians have since been killed, while more than two million have been displaced.Humanitarian organisations like the WFP have struggled to get supplies to those in need in the region, compounding the crisis.“I don’t know where they’re getting the food from,” said Beasley in the wide-ranging interview. “We’re out of fuel. We’re out of cash, in terms of paying our people and we are running out of money and we can’t get our trucks in.”","Just TWO PER CENT of Elon Musk’s wealth could solve world hunger, according to UN food scarcity organisation","['A small group of ultra-wealthy individuals could help solve world hunger with just a fraction of their net worth, says the director of the United Nations’ World Food Program.<n>The net worth of US billionaires has almost doubled since the pandemic began, standing at $US5.04 ($A6.7) trillion in October.<n>Half of the population of Afghanistan - 22.8 million people - face an acute hunger crisis, according to a WFP report released Monday.<n>In Ethiopia, the WFP estimates that 5.2 million people are in urgent need of food assistance.']"

But others were optimistic.While I initially feared leaving my relationship and not having companionship and support, after almost a year, I have never once thought I needed a man to help me.I realise now that wanting love and wanting a man to help me are two very different things.I now know what kind of relationship I want and need.

For much of the 20th century, homes were far more affordable.""Between the years immediately after World War II and … and the early 1970s, houses basically cost three times average male annual earnings. And that ratio didn't really change much over a period of almost 30 years,"" Mr Eslake says.Now, house prices and wages have completely decoupled.Watch the full investigation on ABC iview or livestream on the Four Corners Facebook page.In another old home on the market for the first time in decades, Four Corners found evidence that points to one of the big shifts that's driven up house prices.Under the floor coverings was an old newspaper from 1963. At first blush, the headline seemed to imply things weren't so different back then. It read: ""Why can't young couples buy homes?""Read the fine print, though, and it tells a different story.The problem then was that banks were heavily controlled, and lending was strictly rationed.First home buyers had to pay huge deposits — up to a third of the value of the property — and banks were extremely conservative about how much they would lend.Not enough ""cheap"" money available, the article complained.That all changed in the 1990s because of two things: The deregulation of the banking system and a huge fall in interest rates after the crushing of the era of high inflation.Suddenly, banks were willing to lend people huge sums of money to buy houses, and lower interest rates meant people could borrow plenty.In markets with limited supply, the combination of easy credit and cheap money has just encouraged people competing for homes to borrow more and more.That's been turbocharged in the COVID-19 era by the lowest interest rates in history.The result is that house prices in Australia have risen by 550 per cent since the early 1990s, with no letup in sight. Rising real estate prices have created a lot of winners.""For a majority of Australians, the property market has been an escalator to ever-greater levels of personal wealth. And, if you've been able to get on that escalator at the bottom, you've done exceptionally well over the following 30 years,"" Mr Eslake says.""If you've been able to hop onto it at different points during that period, you've also shared in those gains. But, if you're part of an increasing minority of Australians who haven't been able to get the first foot on that escalator, you've missed out.""Read some more of the best digital stories and interactives by Four Corners.The gap between the housing haves and have nots is often seen as a generational divide, but the reality is that many young people will be helped into the property market by their parents — the bank of mum and dad — and many will also inherit enormous wealth generated by the soaring price of real estate.The real losers are those who do not come from money.People like Ashley May, who works as a mental health nurse in Hobart and resides in social housing with her mother, who lives with a disability. Ashley yearns to buy a home for them both.She has a master's degree, a good job, and she assumed she would be able to save up and buy a home. But, amid soaring house prices in Hobart, once an affordable city, she's been priced out.""The situation's left me feeling completely defeated, you know, like there's no point,"" she laments. ""I did everything right. I did everything that every politician has ever told us to do.""We were told, growing up, that, you know, the Australian dream, owning your own house, all you have to do to get that is you go to school, go to college, go to university, get a good job, and boom, Bob's your uncle. But it's just not turned out that way."" Adrian Pisarski, executive officer of the housing advocacy group National Shelter, believes the problem is only going to get worse.""Only the children of people who already have wealth, will be able to acquire home ownership in the future,"" he said.""People who come from poorer backgrounds won't. It's really become a class divide.""A nation that once prided itself on its egalitarianism and its high levels of home ownership is experiencing rising inequality, due to a growing chasm of wealth between those who own homes, and those who never will.""Housing has become, rather than a place of security where you raise a family, something that you seek to create wealth from and speculate on,"" Mr Pisarski said.""So, that is a really big shift over the last 40 years. And it's one that I don't think will serve the future well.""Additional reporting by Lesley Robinson and Patrick Begley.We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.This service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.AEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)","From a 'class divide' to 'intergenerational theft', Australia's real estate frenzy leaves many behind","[""From a 'class divide' to 'intergenerational theft', Australia's real estate frenzy leaves many behind.<n>Premier Mark McGowan says Western Australia will open up its borders when 90 per cent of the state’s population aged above 12 years old is fully vaccinated against Covid-19.<n>A second covid case has been detected in the Northern Territory after a man in his 20s in Katherine returned a positive test yesterday.""]"
12,"'Drama Jana' no more: How Australia's one-time golden girl Jana Pittman continues to surprisePremier Mark McGowan says Western Australia will open up its borders when 90 per cent of the state’s population aged above 12 years old is fully vaccinated against Covid-19A second covid case has been detected in the Northern Territory after a man in his 20s in Katherine returned a positive test yesterdayFollow our live coverage for the latest news on the coronavirus pandemicThree-time Olympian, two-time world champion, fallen heroine, spat on in a parade, cancer scare survivor, soon to be mother-of-six, doctor, egg donor, TV warrior woman.By her own admission, Jana Pittman feels like she's ""lived five lives"" during her 39 years on the planet.It is a life of such velocity, energy, adrenaline and determination that in the early 2000s she was the fastest 400-metre hurdler in the world. A golden girl with thousands of people cheering her on.However, with the glory came the price. With the triumphs came the tragedies.""There's definitely some drama associated [with] my early career,"" Pittman says.""I've had many failures in life. I'm very honest, very emotional and dramatic as a human.""Pittman was a world champion athlete carrying the hopes of the nation. But showing her emotions at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games turned her into a public pariah virtually overnight.For many years she suppressed the personality that earned her the “Drama Jana” nickname until she became a cardboard cutout of herself, and stopped winning races.It was becoming a doctor that brought her back to her true passionate self.Now Pittman has come full circle in public perception with a starring role on reality TV series SAS Australia. In learning to accept herself it seems the public have accepted her too.At school, the cool girls weren't friends with Jana Pittman. She was that girl; the dork desperate to be liked.""I've always felt a bit weird, quirky in that I'm extremely driven and studied all the time,"" Pittman says.""I talk really fast and I guess I'm not to everybody's taste. I struggled to fit in. I have always struggled with self-esteem.""However, in sport, when she flew across the track, she was a different person. In sport, the girl who ""didn't have a huge social network"", could make friends.As a small child she had wanted to be a doctor, but that idea was sidelined as she rose to the pinnacle of athletics.By 15, she had won the World Youth Championship in Poland. At 19, she won gold at the Commonwealth Games in Manchester.But all the sacrifices of her teenage years, the countless hours of hard training, the pain of pushing herself to extremes, were with one image in her mind: Standing on the podium holding an Olympic gold medal.""The dream to win an Olympic gold medal for me dominated everything — my social life, my every waking moment. In fact, it became an obsession rather than a passion,"" Pittman admits.At age 20, when she won the World Championships in Paris in 2003, only two-tenths of a second outside the world record, Olympic gold seemed well within her reach.""Jana suddenly became a very big name in Australia with all the expectation that we might have another track and field Olympic champion just four years after Cathy Freeman,"" veteran sports commentator Bruce McAvaney says.Suddenly, the girl who craved approval was in the spotlight. And everything would change.""That is a big, big step for a young athlete to take,"" Pittman says.""I really struggled with the attention, and part of me loved it. And the other part of me didn't know how to handle it. I didn't know how to say the right things. I didn't know when to say 'no' to interviews.""She was so close. In the lead up to the Athens Olympics in 2004, her former coach Phil King says, ""she was in massive shape"".""I was very confident she was going to win [at] the Games.""However, warming up for the final race before the Games she heard a big ""pop"". It was her knee, a torn cartilage.An orthopedic surgeon told her she was finished. Then a phone call came from a surgeon in the UK saying he thought he could fix it.After the operation Pittman walked out of the hospital and dramatically threw away her crutches in front of waiting media.That was the day the media first christened her ""Drama Jana"".""One of the things I wholeheartedly wish I could take back was when I threw my crutches away,"" Pittman reflects.""I saw that as a moment of showing Aussie strength, of showing, 'Look what we can do' but, looking back on it, I can see how dramatic that would have looked.""And it just fuelled the whole 'Jana Drama'. Actually, I think that's where it started.""Injured and unable to train properly, she finished fifth in the Athens Games.Even now she says, ""It's still a race I play a lot in my head. I still feel that pain.""All the years of single-minded preparation and she had failed. She was devastated.""I was in tears. And they did not stop for a good couple of hours. And, unfortunately, we didn't know that there were cameras over the fence.""In that moment, being perceived a sore loser, she says, ""my reputation was torn to shreds"".Her family was chased through the streets of Athens by the media in cars and on motorbikes.The press and, it seemed, the whole country had turned against her.From the girl who had just wanted to be liked she was now the most unpopular person in the nation. And she was stuck with that unflattering nickname.""From that moment, and for the rest of my sports career, I carried that with me,"" Pittman says. ""There was a lot of negative press.""She was 21 years old.Pittman was actually frightened to go out into the stadium when she won gold at the Melbourne Commonwealth Games in 2006, fearing she ""would have an unpopular reaction from the crowd"".That year she married her then-coach, Chris Rawlinson. It was only seven months after the birth of her son, Cornelis, that she won the world championships for a second time in Osaka.For about eight years she tried hard to be un-dramatic, to talk herself down.""People hate me, it has to be my fault,"" she remembers thinking.""I tried to say the right things, do the right things and, funnily enough, I never won races very much again.""I was miserable, and I was cardboard. I wasn't real, I wasn't authentic. My marriage fell apart. And I honestly lost who I was.""By the time injury once again caused her to pull out of the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and then the London Olympics in 2012, her athletics career was unravelling.For an athlete still charged by adrenaline, the end of a career can be a dangerous time.Her mother, Jackie Pittman, suggested she return to her childhood dream of medicine.""I thought, 'How can I, at 28, start a medical degree? Maybe I'm not bright enough?',"" Pittman says.She failed the entrance exam the first time, but got in the second time.In 2014, she was invited to use her explosive speed to push a bobsled and took a semester off to train and compete at the Sochi Olympics.She came 14th, becoming the first Australian woman to compete in both a summer and winter Olympic Games.Pittman returned to her studies and won her cohort's university medal, easing the pain of never winning at the Olympics.When she graduated, ""I felt finally like I was on 100 per cent on the right trajectory in my life.""Pittman has brought all the energy, determination and adrenaline to her medical career that took her to the track.""I would say that Jana is in the fast lane,"" husband Paul Gatward says.""She was in the fast lane in athletics and she is on the fast lane in real life.""The degree of effort and tenacity and the desire to pursue is just as important in medicine as it is in athletics.""More importantly, the resident doctor at Blacktown Hospital in western Sydney is herself again: driven, passionate.""It took me a long time to appreciate rather than hate the drama side of me,"" Pittman says.""Since I have accepted that is who I am, it is something I can use as a positive.""Jackie says her daughter is a changed woman.""Jana's gone from, to some extent, loving the limelight, to now being more dedicated to giving back to others.""Jana Pittman's life would take another big turn when a cancer scare saw the doctor become the patient.""I was diagnosed with CIN 3, which is basically one step away from cervical cancer and certainly needed treatment,"" Pittman says.""I had to have part of my cervix removed.""Knowing she could lose her entire cervix in the future and that she didn't want her son to be an only child, the then-single mother began exploring other paths to motherhood.She and her mother looked at the sperm donor list and chose one they thought would be a good match.Emily was born in 2015 and then Jemima in 2016 to the same anonymous donor father.""I'm very grateful to that man for donating his sperm,"" Pittman says.Having had her own experience in the field of reproductive medicine, the path forward suddenly became clear.""It was a light bulb moment to think, 'This is where I want to take the rest of my career in medicine, to work in women's health and, particularly, in gynaecology',"" Pittman says.""I really wanted to bring the joy of having children that I felt to other women who were struggling with that.""When Pittman became the ambassador for the Australian Cervical Cancer Foundation, she went on a trip to the Philippines to perform cervical screening tests.She was deeply moved by what she saw: Women who had not had access to the kind of test that she had had.""A lot of these women had never seen a doctor, let alone had a gynaecology exam,"" Pittman says.""There were moments when I was in tears because I knew the news I was giving to this woman [meant she] would be very unlikely to see the end of the year or at least the next couple of years because the cancer was already so advanced.""On their very first date, Pittman and Paul Gatward, a corporate lawyer of 25 years, talked about having children.He describes their relationship as ""a rocket ride"". Married in July, 2020, their son Charlie was born four months later.""Some would say that having an instantaneous family and all those responsibilities dropped into your lap could be a bit of a shock. No, not with Jana,"" he says.""I just describe it as something that was natural and wonderful.""Even with four children, Pittman was not finished with making families. Now she talks to Australian Story for the first time about her own donation journey.""Because I had a wonderful person donate sperm for my daughters, I really wanted to pay it forward for someone else.""Brad Foster is now one of Pittman's best friends after being her long-time massage therapist.For 20 years, he had been her confidant, the person who would always drop everything to pick up the phone during her turbulent times.He wanted children but was in a same-sex relationship.""Jana came up to visit us in late 2018 and, while we were out to dinner, she just dropped a bombshell on us,"" Brad says.""She said, 'I want to give you some eggs'. I'm like, 'Are you for real?'""They fertilised one of her eggs, a surrogate carried the baby and, on November 5, 2019, Màili was born.Pittman is ""Auntie Jana"".""I'm obviously her biological parent and we see each other, COVID pending, as often as possible,"" Pittman says.""I have the opportunity to be involved in their family. We call it our rainbow family, and it is quite a privilege.""Pittman also donated her eggs to another couple who ""had been trying for many, many IVF cycles to have a family"".After years of struggling with her ""Drama Jana"" media image, Pittman has recently enjoyed a reversal of public opinion.Only six months post the birth of baby Charlie, she took part in a reality TV show, SAS Australia, and became a fan favourite, excelling in challenges from rope climbs into a hovering helicopter to daredevil driving through bombs and obstacles.The audience loved her raw honesty about her weak pelvic floor, her mental strength, how she helped others with injuries.Friend and fellow athlete Tamsyn Lewis once described Pittman as a ""mixture of mouse and tiger"": Fierce and competitive yet also insecure and self-doubting.On SAS Australia, the insecure ""mouse"" was gone. Presenter Ant Middleton called her a ""lioness"".""I've had messages saying I'm a queen, a hero and lots of messages saying that they did read me wrong back in the day,"" Pittman says.""It does feel like a lot of the things that happened when I was younger have turned completely the opposite. I've had nothing but beautiful positive responses from SAS.""Now she has joined the Army Reserve.And, more recently, she announced that, after doing her own ultrasound, she is pregnant with twins.""I basically check their little heart rates are going well, and that they're moving around, so it's a real little bit of an insight I get to have as a doctor,"" she says.""And, soon, I'm going to have six children, so it's certainly going to be a busy household next year.""Everyone is waiting for the next instalment in the unstoppable life of Jana Pittman.Watch Australian Story's The Last Hurdle on iview and Youtube.We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.This service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.AEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)",'Drama Jana' no more: How Australia's one-time golden girl Jana Pittman continues to surprise,"['Jana Pittman feels like she\'s ""lived five lives"" during her 39 years on the planet.<n>In the early 2000s she was the fastest 400-metre hurdler in the world.<n>But showing her emotions at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games turned her into a public pariah virtually overnight.<n>Now Pittman has come full circle in public perception with a starring role on reality TV series SAS Australia.']"
13,"Meet the millions of people who aren't employed, who aren't considered 'unemployed'Premier Mark McGowan says Western Australia will open up its borders when 90 per cent of the state’s population aged above 12 years old is fully vaccinated against Covid-19A second covid case has been detected in the Northern Territory after a man in his 20s in Katherine returned a positive test yesterdayFollow our live coverage for the latest news on the coronavirus pandemicDid you know there are millions of Australians without work who aren't counted in the unemployment rate?There's a reason for it.I'll show you who they are and how many want to be working.I'll also show how many could start work immediately if they had better support, such as suitable child care.Just quickly, this is the third part of a series I've been doing on the unemployment rate.In Part 1, I explained why the official definition of ""unemployment"" leaves millions of people out of the unemployment data.Part 2 showed why the unemployment statistics are actually designed for employers, not job seekers.To illustrate what I mean on that second point, have a look at the graph below.What do you think the unemployment rate is telling you? Here's what it isn't telling you.The unemployment rate is not telling you what percentage of Australians were without work each month over the last 20 years.Far from it.It's telling employers and economists what percentage of people in the ""labour force"" were immediately available to fill a vacancy in any month.See those points I've highlighted where the unemployment rate is 5.5 per cent but the ""participation rate"" is different each time?That's telling you something important.It's letting you know that, even though the unemployment rate is the same number in 2004, 2009, 2017 and 2021, none of those numbers are actually comparable.Not if you think they're telling you about the strength of the economy.Has a politician ever explained that to you?Anyway, let's get into the next bit — which is why we're here.See the image below. It's a simplified model of the labour force framework.I want to talk about all of the people who are consigned to that big yellow box called ""Not in the Labour Force.""That's where millions of Australians are sitting who aren't employed, yet they aren't included in the official unemployment rate.You can be in that group for lots of reasons. Traditionally, you might be:The Bureau of Statistics has released some really interesting information on this group.It took a snapshot of the population in February when the economy was recovering strongly after last year's lockdowns (before the Delta outbreak in New South Wales in June), and here's what it found.In February, there were 20.7 million usually resident people in the working-age population who were 15 years or over, of whom:Notice that second point? There were 2.2 million people who weren't employed and wanted to work, but just 808,000 of them were considered officially unemployed.That means there were 1.4 million people who weren't working and wanted to work.But they were shunted off into the ""Not in the Labour Force"" group, where they didn't affect the unemployment rate.How could that be?Did you know if you're not working or officially unemployed, you're hidden from the unemployment rate?It's because the definition of ""unemployed"" is deliberately restrictive.To be considered officially unemployed you have to be actively looking for work and available to start immediately.If you're available to start work in four weeks, but not immediately, you're not considered unemployed.Why? Because, as I explained in Part 1, the labour force framework is designed for employers and economists.It's focused on solving immediate problems for employers.For example, imagine it's February and you're an employer who needs to fill some job vacancies this week.Do you know how many unemployed people there are who are immediately available to start work?You do.According to the ABS, there were an estimated 808,000 people who didn't have a job in February but who were actively looking and were ready to start immediately.That was the pool of officially unemployed people from which you could have hired extra workers to fill an immediate vacancy.Anyway, let's see who those other 1.4 million people were who also wanted work.The ABS starts with this simple graphical representation.Then, it presents that information in a slightly more detailed way.It says of the 2.2 million who wanted to work (which includes the officially unemployed):And here's how the ABS categorises them.Now, an immediate question that might spring to mind is: if there were over 1 million people wanted to work but didn't look for work, why didn't they look for work?Well, as the ABS explains, life is complicated.It says people who aren't going to be available for work in the short to medium-term may not begin looking for work until closer to when they'll be able to work. In fact, of the 1,081,000 people who did not look for work, over three-quarters of them (862,200 people) wanted to work and were available to start immediately or within 4 weeks.Here are the main reasons why they didn't actively look for work in February:Notice how nearly 140,000 people wanted paid employment but didn't look for it because they couldn't find suitable child care?Over 90 per cent of them were women.If there was suitable child care available they'd be able to start work immediately.Another 64,700 people wanted to work, but didn't look for it, because of family considerations or caring responsibilities.Nearly 75 per cent of them were women.There were 113,000 people who wanted to work but had become so discouraged by their inability to find work that they'd stopped looking.Another 110,000 people wanted to work but ill-health, injury, or disability meant they couldn't look for it.Anyway, I'll leave it there.Hopefully, it shows you how there are hundreds of thousands of people who aren't employed and are immediately available to start work, yet they're not counted as officially ""unemployed.""They don't affect the unemployment rate. But as ABS reminds us, it's not as though life is easy for the 808,000 officially unemployed people either.In February, despite the strength of the economic recovery at that time, nearly 90 per cent of people who were considered officially unemployed (and therefore did affect the unemployment rate) still had difficulties finding work.Those difficulties included: age discrimination, lack of nearby public transport, lack of suitable skills, and too much competition from other job seekers.And to put things in perspective.In the February quarter, there were just 289,000 job vacancies.But 2.2 million people wanted a job.We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.This service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.AEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)","Meet the millions of people who aren't employed, who aren't considered 'unemployed'","['Meet the millions of people who aren\'t employed, who aren\'t considered \'unemployed\'<n>The unemployment rate is not telling you what percentage of Australians were without work each month over the last 20 years.<n>It\'s telling employers and economists what percentage of people in the ""labour force"" were immediately available to fill a vacancy in any month.']"
14,"ScienceHow to survive a venomous snakebite — from a professional who's been bitten beforePremier Mark McGowan says Western Australia will open up its borders when 90 per cent of the state’s population aged above 12 years old is fully vaccinated against Covid-19A second covid case has been detected in the Northern Territory after a man in his 20s in Katherine returned a positive test yesterdayFollow our live coverage for the latest news on the coronavirus pandemic""Am I going to die?""It's a question you ask yourself after being bitten by a venomous snake.It's a question I've asked myself once. My husband, Chris Hay, has asked himself four times.Deaths from snakebite rarely occur in Australia — two people die per year on average.From 2000-2013, there were fewer deaths from snakebites than from bees, wasps, ants, and ticks.Believe it or not, horse-riding is at least five times more deadly than snakes are in Australia; at least 11–20 people die from horse-related accidents annually.Compared to India, where at least 42,000 snakebite deaths occur annually, we are indeed a lucky country when it comes to snakes.But while there are only a couple of deaths each year, it's estimated there are about 3,000 snakebites in Australia annually.I have adored snakes since childhood, and with my husband Chris, I own 26 snakes, 16 of which are highly venomous. They’re pets that we use for venomous snake handling courses and venom extraction.Chris and I do venom extractions for research, and handle a lot of venomous snakes — it's our profession.While we are professional snake handlers (and even conduct courses on handling snakes), we're still human and have made a few mistakes over the years.I was once bitten by a highly venomous dugite (Pseudonaja affinis), a type of brown snake from the Perth area that causes more deaths there than any other snake.Chris was put into a coma for three days after a death adder bite.This is how we survived, and how you can too — even if you're unlucky enough to be bitten by one of the world's most venomous snakes.First thing's first: The best way to survive a snakebite, of course, is to never be bitten.Contrary to common opinion, snakes are rarely aggressive. They're cowards.Humans are giant adversaries to snakes, so they do their best to avoid us.The best way to avoid a snakebite is to simply give snakes space.A well-designed study that tracked humans and eastern brown snakes (Pseudonaja textilis) — the most feared snake in Australia — revealed that less than 1 per cent of encounters with snakes resulted in a strike.Most of the time snakes retreated without even being seen, or froze to avoid detection. While you may think that most snake bites occur out bush, research in 2016 showed ""the majority of snakebite fatalities [in Australia] occur around a person's residence within a major city or inner regional area"".That doesn't mean you need to live your life indoors — our dislike for lockdowns says it all.But keeping your distance from any snakes you see is a good start.Wearing shoes is one of the best ways to prevent a snakebite, because most accidental bites occur to the lower limbs. Lighting the ground while walking outside at night in the summertime is also advised.And don't ever handle a snake. Even if you think you know the type of snake, most Australians are actually very poor at identifying snakes correctly. If needed, snake catchers have the expertise and equipment to catch and relocate snakes for you.Keep your pets in mind too. Snakebite in domestic animals (cats, dogs, horses, and cattle) is around twice as frequent as for humans.  My research has shown that dogs are particularly susceptible to procoagulant snake venoms — that's venom that causes many micro clots in the blood.It's best to keep dogs on leashes and cats indoors. This protects your pets and our wildlife. Win win!When bitten by a snake, the Jaanga First Nations people of inland Queensland survived by laying down under a tree and not moving a muscle for four to five days while their people brought them food and water.Source: Healthdirect AustraliaNowadays, with a good supply of quality antivenom, no-one should ever die of snakebite in Australia.The important thing to know is how to manage the bite — a common trend I've noticed about snakebite deaths in Australia is failure to manage the bite correctly.  So what's the best course of action?When I was bitten by the dugite, my arm was compression-bandaged within 30 seconds and I was at the hospital within eight minutes. The whole time staying still.This is exemplary action in a snakebite situation.So stay as still as possible. Don't move a muscle, because moving moves the venom through the body.Then, wrap the affected limb with a stretchy compression bandage — like you would for a sprained ankle/wrist.It's a good idea to always have a compression bandage handy, especially when perusing the paddock or bush-bashing. But if caught without a stretchy bandage, use anything possible to apply compression.Start from the end of the limb, working your way all the way up, using a second bandage if needed. Then, immobilise the limb in a splint, if possible.This simple technique slows the flow of venom and delays systemic toxicity — that's toxicity to your whole body. This should give you six to 10 hours of time to undertake the next vital step — get to hospital for antivenom treatment.Time is critical. Ring an ambulance and get to hospital as fast as possible so that antivenom can be given to neutralise the toxins before they reach their molecular targets and do their deadly damage.This is how to treat snakebite in Australia. If you're travelling overseas, make sure you find out the advice for snakes in that country.Chris would be dead without antivenom.A massive barkly death adder (Acanthophis hawkei), with its potent neurotoxic and myotoxic venom, put him in a coma for three days and gave him permanent kidney damage.While my dugite bite didn't require antivenom, I was certainly glad they had it on hand.The last thing to remember to survive a snakebite is this: do not let medical staff remove your compression bandage quickly, or unwrap it to ""check if symptoms develop"".Removing the bandage fast is like opening the floodgates for venom. Your body may go into shock as a result. The bandage should be removed slowly over the course of an hour, in sections, starting from the top down.So, the next time you happen upon a snake — or are unlucky enough to be bitten by one — just remember these tips from a snake-handling professional.Dr Christina Zdenek is a biologist and toxinologist at the University of Queensland.

15,"Composite glass breakthrough by Queensland researchers could help make phone screens 'unbreakable'Premier Mark McGowan says Western Australia will open up its borders when 90 per cent of the state’s population aged above 12 years old is fully vaccinated against Covid-19A second covid case has been detected in the Northern Territory after a man in his 20s in Katherine returned a positive test yesterdayFollow our live coverage for the latest news on the coronavirus pandemicAustralians destroy or lose more than 1,300 smartphones a day, with cracked and shattered screens the most common way of damaging them.They have forked out a staggering $755 million over a five-year period to fix them, according to data from the comparison website Finder. Now, thanks to a crack team of scientists at the University of Queensland working with researchers across the world, smashed phone screens could become a thing of the past.The team has unlocked technology to produce the next-generation of composite glass used in smart phones, televisions, computers and even LED lights.Chemical engineer Jingwei Hou said the findings would enable the manufacture of glass screens that are both unbreakable and deliver crystal clear image quality.""The problem we have every day — I have broken four or five iPhone screens through the whole year — costs all of us a lot to repair,"" Dr Hou said.""When I came into this, I thought 'wouldn't it be amazing if we could fix the problem getting the screen more flexible and more durable at the same time.'""He said the glass currently used in phones was very dense and inflexible.""Which means it breaks.""To address the breakage issue, he turned to a mineral called perovskite, a calcium titanium oxide crystal.But Dr Hou said the researchers found perovskite ""nanocrystals"" were extremely sensitive to light, heat, air and water.""So our team of chemical engineers and material scientists then developed a revolutionary process to wrap or bind the nanocrystals in porous glass,"" he said.""This process is the key to stabilising the materials, enhancing efficiency and inhibiting the toxic lead ions from leaching out.""Perovskites are a very functional material, but because of their sensitivity to almost everything they need to be put into the glass.""They take a raw material, like zinc, and use an organic molecule that can bind to zinc. They then use mechanical force to turn it into glass.Millions of tiny holes invisible to the human eye are injected with the nanocrystals and stay protected, wrapped inside. ""By doing that we can stabilise the material and enable it to be used for new products like flexible solar panels, display screens unlike anything you've ever seen before, or more detailed medical imaging which would obviously lead to better patient outcomes,"" he said.""It would be the equivalent of upgrading from an iPhone 1 to a DSLR camera.""UQ faculty of engineering executive dean Vicki Chen said the technology was scalable and opened the door for many applications.She called it the ""holy grail of solar cell technology"" because of its ability to also create and convert light.""The issue always has been stability, stability, stability but the fact we can combine this new generation of materials with perovskite and make it possible to have great stability means it can now be used in industrial applications,"" Professor Chen said.""Perovskites can convert light energy into electrical energy, but you can also excite them with electromagnetic radiation — have them emit all kinds of colours, which means you can have all kind of bright displays, using less energy and have incredible colour resolutions.""Dr Hou said research was underway in collaboration with the University of Leeds, University of Cambridge and the Université Paris-Saclay.He said this would enable them to create mobile phones, TVs, computers and virtual reality imaging that had ""stunning picture quality and strength"".Dr Hou said their research would also look at a solar panel that converts lights to energy through the nano glass on a smartphone.""A solar panel converts light to energy [and] a display screen converts energy to light,"" he said.""It may be possible in future to create one material that can do both.""So it could be showing a crystal-clear image and then when it's not in use, it would charge the battery, even from indoor lighting.""Technology expert and Vertical Hold podcast co-host Alex Kidman said the glass in smartphones had gotten much better over time.""We have had increasingly more robust glass, especially if you are a buyer of premium phones,"" Mr Kidman said.""But even then there is a bit of a balancing act between rigidity — whether or not it is going to smash — and scratch resistance.""Because the more rigid you make the glass, paradoxically the more likely it is to scratch.""He said the Finder 2017 research found Australians smashed more than 460,000 phone a year — about 1,300 a day on average.Globally, tech companies sell about 1.3 billion smartphones a year.""A lot of the big phone makers and the way those phones are currently built makes it very difficult to get repairs done by third parties,"" Mr Kidman said.""You usually have to go to them directly or one of their authorised agents. That costs a whole lot more.""As soon as you drop it, you have a 50-50 chance of it landing on the screen and cracking.""He said billions were being spent on research and development, and the UQ research had commercial promise if they could ""critically scale it up"" for low-cost mass production.""The question is can we make it for a million phones without each of those phones costing a million dollars.""He also said there was a risk marketing a product as unbreakable.""Somebody will always find a way to break it.""But he said the research was exciting for the industry.""There are all sorts of added benefits, because a tougher phone, TV or even a light bulb is going to last you a whole lot longer, which means you are talking about less e-waste, potentially less energy usage if they are brighter and have more clarity or indeed an LED behind your smart phone screen.""So there is all sorts of added benefits to this … it is one of the reasons there is so much money in it.""The findings have been published in the journal Science.We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.This service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.AEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)",Composite glass breakthrough by Queensland researchers could help make phone screens 'unbreakable',"[""Composite glass breakthrough by Queensland researchers could help make phone screens 'unbreakable'<n>The team has unlocked technology to produce the next-generation of composite glass used in smart phones, televisions, computers and even LED lights.<n>Technology expert and Vertical Hold podcast co-host Alex Kidman said the glass in smartphones had gotten much better over time.""]"
